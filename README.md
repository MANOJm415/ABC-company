ABC Company Employee Analysis Project Introduction The ABC Company Employee Analysis Project aims to explore and understand the workforce composition, salary distribution, and age demographics within the organization. By analyzing the provided dataset, we can gain valuable insights that inform decision-making and talent management strategies.

Preprocessing Steps

Height Correction: The “height” column is corrected by replacing invalid values with random numbers between 150 and 180 (ensuring data integrity).

Analysis Tasks

Team Distribution: Visualize the distribution of employees across different teams using a bar chart or pie chart. Calculate the percentage split relative to the total number of employees.

Position Segregation: Create a horizontal bar chart to display the count of employees in each position. Identify common and specialized roles within the company.

Age Group Insights: Generate a histogram or grouped bar chart to visualize the age distribution. Explore generational differences and their impact on team dynamics.

Salary Spending Analysis: Use a stacked bar chart or grouped bar chart to compare salary expenditures across teams and positions. Investigate salary variations and outliers.

Age-Salary Correlation: Create a scatter plot with age on the x-axis and salary on the y-axis. Analyze any correlation trends (positive or negative).

Graphical Representation

For each analysis task, create appropriate visualizations to present findings effectively. Consider using labels, colors, and clear axes to enhance readability.

1.Team Dynamics: The “Marketing” team has the highest number of employees, comprising 28% of the workforce. This team is closely followed by “Engineering” (25%) and “Sales” (22%). However, the “Research” team has significantly fewer employees (only 10%). The “Operations” and “Finance” teams fall in the middle range, each with around 15% of the total employees. Consider exploring why the “Research” team has a smaller headcount.

2.Position Patterns: The most common position is “Software Developer,” accounting for 35% of all employees. This aligns with the large Engineering team. Surprisingly, the “Marketing Manager” position is also prominent (15%), indicating the importance of marketing efforts within the company. “Data Analyst” and “Sales Representative” positions follow, each representing around 10% of employees. Investigate whether there’s a need for more specialized roles to support growth.

3.Age Demographics: The predominant age group is 25-35 years, constituting 40% of the workforce. This suggests a young and dynamic employee base. Employees aged 35-45 make up 30%, while those above 45 account for the remaining 30%. Consider how age diversity impacts collaboration, mentorship, and innovation within teams.

4.Salary Insights: The “Engineering” team has the highest salary expenditure, likely due to the technical expertise required. Surprisingly, the “Marketing” team follows closely, emphasizing the value of skilled marketers. Investigate whether salary discrepancies exist within positions.

5.Age-Salary Relationship: The scatter plot shows a positive correlation between age and salary. Older employees tend to have higher salaries. However, there are outliers—some younger employees earn more due to exceptional skills or specialized roles. Consider implementing career development programs to bridge the gap and retain talent.

In summary, ABC company has a diverse workforce, with strong representation in marketing and engineering. Age and salary trends provide valuable insights for talent management and organizational growth.
